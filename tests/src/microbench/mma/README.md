# MMA Microbenchmark Suite

This directory contains MMA-focused microbenchmarks for Tensor Core issue gap,
peak throughput, and instruction-latency calibration.

There are two build paths:

- gtest microbenchmarks (`inst_latency_bench.cc`, `mma_issue_bench.cc`) are
  built through `microbench/sm120/mma`.
- standalone CUDA calibration binaries (`mma_accept_queue_bench.cu`,
  `mma_saturation_bench.cu`) are built by the same group or from this directory
  with the local Makefile.
  They are emitted under `tests/build/bin/microbench/mma/`.

## Supported Tests

Run the gtest probes from `tests/` through `microbench/sm120/mma`.

| Test | Source | Description | Output |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `MMAIssueTest.ILPMinimal` | `mma_issue_bench.cc` | Typed test that sweeps ILP `{1,2,4,8}` for every supported MMA variant. | `MMAIssueTest.ILPMinimal.<variant>.txt` |
| `MMAIssueTest.MultiWarpMinimal` | `mma_issue_bench.cc` | Typed test that sweeps warp count `{1,2,4,8,16,32}` for every supported MMA variant. | `MMAIssueTest.MultiWarpMinimal.<variant>.txt` |
| `MMAIssueSummary.AllVariants` | `mma_issue_bench.cc` | Cross-variant summary of cycles per MMA from the issue-gap microbench. | `MMAIssueTest.Summary.txt` |
| `MMAPeak.AllVariants` | `mma_issue_bench.cc` | Full-device peak throughput summary across all MMA variants. | `MMAPeak.Summary.txt` |
| `InstLatencyTest.FullCalibrationSuite` | `inst_latency_bench.cc` | Broad scalar/SFU/MMA instruction-latency calibration sweep used for simulator tuning. | Timestamped `tests/run/logs/inst_latency_*.log` |

## Variant Coverage

`mma_issue_bench.cc` uses `TYPED_TEST_SUITE`, so the issue-gap benchmarks run
for every supported MMA op in one build. There is no longer a manual
`CurrentMmaOp` switch in the source.

- `MmaOp_F16_M16N8K16`
- `MmaOp_F16_M16N8K8`
- `MmaOp_BF16_M16N8K8`
- `MmaOp_TF32_M16N8K8`
- `MmaOp_TF32_M16N8K4`
- `MmaOp_S8_M16N8K32`
- `MmaOp_S8_M16N8K16`

## Example Commands

```bash
./run_tests.py run --arch sm120 --group microbench --profile mma \
  "MMAIssueTest.ILPMinimal"
./run_tests.py run --arch sm120 --group microbench --profile mma \
  "MMAIssueSummary.AllVariants"
./run_tests.py run --arch sm120 --group microbench --profile mma \
  "InstLatencyTest.FullCalibrationSuite"
./run_tests.py build --arch sm90 --group microbench --profile mma
```

For `MMAPeak.AllVariants`, `BestILP` and `Blocks/SM` are chosen by sweeping
candidate launch settings and keeping the highest measured throughput point.
`Meas GHz`, `Theo Now`, and `% Peak` are all derived from the measured runtime
clock instead of a fixed spec clock.

## Running Calibration

To compare native hardware against GPGPU-Sim, use the provided Python script:

```bash
# From repository root
python3 tests/src/microbench/mma/run_calibration.py

# Or from tests/ directory
python3 src/microbench/mma/run_calibration.py
```

This script:
1. Runs `MMAIssueTest.ILPMinimal` and `MMAIssueTest.MultiWarpMinimal` on native hardware.
2. Sources `setup_environment`, then reruns the same cases on GPGPU-Sim.
3. Captures the per-variant outputs and generates comparison plots/CSVs in `tests/calibration_results/`.

- `calibration_results/ilp_issue_gap_calibration.csv`
- `calibration_results/multiwarp_throughput_calibration.png`
- `calibration_results/multiwarp_throughput_calibration.csv`

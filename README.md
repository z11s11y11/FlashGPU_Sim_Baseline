## Roadmap

| Direction | Status | Planned work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blackwell features | In progress | Extend the SM120/RTX 5090 model with features used by FlashAttention-4, including `tcgen05` |
| Distributed shared memory | In progress | Model thread-block cluster features, such as remote shared-memory addressing |

## Quick Start

### Dependencies

Simulator Build:

- CUDA Toolkit 12.8 or later (required for SM120 support)
- GCC/G++ with C++17 and OpenMP support
- GNU Make, Python 3, Flex, Bison, zlib development headers, and X11/OpenGL development
  headers

Triton Capture:

- Tested with Python 3.12.3, PyTorch 2.9.0, Triton 3.5.0, and NumPy 2.4.0

A physical GPU is not required to build or run FlashGPU-Sim;
it is only needed for Triton autotuning, reference-output capture, and Nsight Compute measurements.

> An experimental [Docker development environment](docker/README.md) is also
> available.

### Build the Simulator

Configure the environment and build the simulator from the repository root:

```bash
export CUDA_INSTALL_PATH=/path/to/cuda
source setup_environment
make -j $(nproc)
```

> Remember to export `CUDA_INSTALL_PATH` and source `setup_environment`
> whenever you open a new shell to build or run simulations.

### Run a Simulation

Using the environment configured above, run the bundled CUDA vector addition example:

```bash
cd tutorials/vectorAdd
./run.sh
```

To capture and simulate the bundled Triton GEMM, open a **CLEAN** shell with
access to an RTX 5090 and the [Triton capture dependencies](#dependencies).
If no RTX 5090 is available, run only `cd tutorials/triton-gemm` and `./run.sh`; it will use the pre-captured files.

```bash
cd tutorials/triton-gemm
python -m pip install -e ../../tools
./capture.sh
./run.sh
```

A successful CUDA run reports `Test PASSED`, while a successful Triton replay
reports `Validation PASSED`. Both workflows save simulator output to
`run/simulation.log` in their respective tutorial directories. Triton capture
output is saved separately to `run/capture.log`.

### Cycle Validation

The quick PR checks keep the documented simulator cycles below synchronized
with `gpu_tot_sim_cycle`. The table also compares them with
`sm__cycles_elapsed.avg` reported by Nsight Compute on an RTX 5090. Difference
is calculated as `(Sim - NCU) / NCU`.

| Config | Workload | Shape | NCU cycles | Sim cycles | Difference |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| SM120_RTX5090 | Tutorial - CUDA Vector Add | 2,000,000 elements | 29,642.67 | 30,133 | +1.65% |
| SM120_RTX5090 | Tutorial - Triton GEMM | `M=2560, N=64, K=2560` | 77,190.74 | 78,989 | +2.33% |

> [!TIP]
> We provide RTX 5090 Nsight Compute reports and CSVs for
> [CUDA vector addition](tutorials/vectorAdd/reference/),
> [Triton GEMM](tutorials/triton-gemm/reference/), and
> [Triton FlashAttention](tutorials/triton-flash-attention/reference/)
> to support validation without a physical RTX 5090.
>
> To regenerate the provided data on compatible hardware, lock the GPU clocks
> and run
> `./tutorials/profile_ncu.sh --gpu 0 <workload>`,
> where `<workload>` can be `all`, `vectorAdd`, `triton-gemm`, or
> `triton-flash-attention`.

The full Triton FlashAttention cycle check is intentionally omitted from PR
CI because of its simulation runtime. After completing the Quick Start build,
run the offline capture and simulation locally when broader validation is
needed:

```bash
bash tutorials/triton-flash-attention/capture.sh
bash tutorials/triton-flash-attention/run.sh
```

## Tutorials

The bundled scripts automate each example end to end; the sections below
break down the same workflows for adaptation to custom CUDA and Triton
workloads.

### Run with CUDA

This workflow manually steps through the [CUDA vector addition](tutorials/vectorAdd/) example.

**Prerequisite**: Ensure FlashGPU-Sim is built.

If this is a new shell, restore the FlashGPU-Sim environment from the
repository root:

```bash
export CUDA_INSTALL_PATH=/path/to/cuda
source setup_environment
```

Enter the example directory:

```bash
cd tutorials/vectorAdd
```

#### Step 1: Compile the CUDA Workload

Create a `run/` directory and compile `vectorAdd.cu` with the shared CUDA runtime,
generating a code image and retaining PTX for the target
architecture. The following example targets SM120:

```bash
mkdir -p run
nvcc -std=c++17 -cudart shared \
  -gencode arch=compute_120a,code=sm_120a \
  -gencode arch=compute_120a,code=compute_120a \
  vectorAdd.cu -o run/vectorAdd
```

The `compute_120a` and `sm_120a` targets match the bundled
`configs/SM120_RTX5090/` configuration. When selecting another simulator
configuration, adjust both targets to its compute capability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> FlashGPU-Sim intercepts CUDA runtime calls by loading its replacement
> `libcudart` through the library path set by `setup_environment`. The
> executable must therefore depend on the shared CUDA runtime.
>
> - When `nvcc` performs the final link, use `-cudart shared`.
> - When `g++` performs the final link, use
>   `-L"$CUDA_INSTALL_PATH/lib64" -lcudart`.
> - Do not link `libcudart_static.a`; embedding the CUDA runtime in the
>   executable prevents FlashGPU-Sim's replacement library from being loaded.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Configuration and Execute

Copy the selected GPU configuration into the `run/` directory. See the
[configuration guide](configs/README.md) for available GPU models, common
parameters, and FlashGPU-Sim-specific options.

```bash
cp -a ../../configs/SM120_RTX5090/. run/
cd run && ./vectorAdd 2>&1 | tee simulation.log
```

FlashGPU-Sim reads `gpgpusim.config` from the current working directory, along
with any files referenced by that configuration. A successful run reports
`Test PASSED` for functional correctness and `gpu_tot_sim_cycle` for the
simulated cycle count; the complete output is saved to `simulation.log`.

### Run with Triton

This workflow manually steps through capture and simulation of the
`triton-gemm` example.

**Prerequisites**: FlashGPU-Sim is built and the [Triton capture dependencies](#dependencies) are available. The main workflow requires an RTX 5090. Without one, use [Offline Mode](#offline-mode) at the end of this section.

From the repository root, enter the example directory:

```bash
cd tutorials/triton-gemm
```

#### Step 1: Capture the Triton Workload

Install TritonTrace in the active Python environment:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ../../tools
```

Capturing custom Triton workloads requires minor instrumentation: import
`TritonTrace`, create a tracker, and enable it around the target kernel launch.
The `gemm.py` example is already instrumented. To capture your own Triton program,
follow the [Online Capture guide](tools/README.md#online-capture).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do NOT source `setup_environment` before capture.** Open a new shell and
> run the capture with the native CUDA stack on the physical GPU.

Run the capture:

```bash
python gemm.py
```

The default workload is a `2560 x 64 x 2560` GEMM. It runs Triton autotuning,
checks the result against PyTorch, and captures one kernel launch under
`run/tracking/`.

#### Step 2: Build the Standalone Harness

```bash
make -C run/tracking/launchers \
  -f kernel_tma_gemm_launch1_Makefile
```

The capture process materializes the Python workload as a standalone CUDA C++
harness. The harness reconstructs the serialized arguments and launch
configuration, reissues the kernel, and validates its output against the
recorded reference data.

#### Step 3: Simulate the Captured Kernel

Copy the matching GPU configuration and run the harness. FlashGPU-Sim
intercepts the launch and simulates the kernel using the captured PTX:

```bash
cp -a ../../configs/SM120_RTX5090/. run/tracking/launchers/
source ../../setup_environment
cd run/tracking/launchers
./kernel_tma_gemm_launch1 2>&1 | tee ../../simulation.log
```

For the GEMM path, a successful run compares every element of the simulated
output with the output recorded during capture and finishes with:

```text
Kernel execution completed successfully
Validation PASSED for arg[2]: all 163840 elements match
Done!
```

<a id="offline-mode"></a>

> [!NOTE]
> **Offline Mode:** GEMM uses Triton autotuning, which needs a physical GPU to
> benchmark its candidate configurations. If no GPU is available, replace Step 1 with
> the fixed-configuration [Triton FlashAttention](tutorials/triton-flash-attention/) example:
>
> ```bash
> cd tutorials/triton-flash-attention
> python -m pip install -e ../../tools
> python flash_attention.py
> ```
>
> For Steps 2 and 3, use the corresponding FlashAttention Makefile and launcher.
> Since Offline Mode does not execute the kernel on a GPU, no reference output is generated.
> A successful replay only reports `Kernel execution completed successfully`.
>
> See [Offline Capture guide](tools/README.md#offline-capture) for details
> on capturing a Triton kernel without GPU execution.

### Update Configuration

FlashGPU-Sim reads `gpgpusim.config` from the workload's current directory at
startup. Configuration changes take effect on the next simulation without
rebuilding FlashGPU-Sim.

See the [Configuration Guide](configs/README.md) for common parameters,
FlashGPU-Sim-specific options, and experimental controls.

### Set CPU Threads

Set the number of CPU threads used by FlashGPU-Sim with `OMP_NUM_THREADS`:

```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
```

We recommend using 4 or 8 threads, as higher counts provided limited additional
speedup in our testing. The maximum supported thread count is 32.
See [Parallel Simulation](docs/development-notes.md#parallel-simulation) for
implementation details.

### Inspect Statistics

FlashGPU-Sim prints detailed simulation statistics to the run log. Use the
provided helper from the repository root to summarize the final statistics
report:

```bash
python3 tests/scripts/extract_sim_stats.py tutorials/vectorAdd/run/simulation.log
```

The summary includes `simulated cycles`, `instructions`, `IPC`, `occupancy`,
`cache statistics`, and `DRAM command counts`. Pass `--all` to inspect every
statistics report or `--csv output.csv` to export the results.
